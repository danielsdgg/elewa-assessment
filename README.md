## styling
Since i am using tailwindcss, i will be styling everything through the 'classnames' of the divs i'm creating. There is some other styling on the App.css file

## Imports
In the Components folder, There are 3 folders; each folder contains components for the pages being created. I will be creating the view and stylings of the page, then importing the functions to the respective files on the pages folder(which is located under src folder)
The Navbar and footer components of the website are located in the components folder. I have parsed the 2 components directly to the main page of the website(App.tsx) ; Where i have also created the routes for navigating through our website
